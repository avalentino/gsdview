InSAR tools
~~~~~~~~~~~

DORIS_
    Delft Object-oriented Radar Interferometric Software - InSAR/DInSAR
    processor.
StaMPS_
    StaMPS stands for "Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers".
    Although the original version was developed at Stanford University,
    subsequent development has taken place at the University of Iceland and
    Delft University of Technology.

    The package is no longer limited to persistent scatterers,
    but also incorporates a small baseline and a combined time series method.
`ADORE DORIS`_
    ADORE stands for Automated DORIS Environment. It is developed at the
    University of Miami Geodesy Group, to help researchers generate
    interferograms with ease. Just like DORIS it is an open source project
    and it comes with the same license. ADORE can not do anything that
    DORIS doesn't, it's only a simplified user interface.
GIAnT_
    GIAnT is a suite of Python libraries and scripts that implement
    various published time-series InSAR algorithms in a common framework.
    GIAnT was developed for:

        * Rapid generation of time-series products from interferogram
        * Direct comparison of time-series InSAR products using different
          algorithms
        * Cal-Val for time-series InSAR

    The toolbox currently includes implementations of SBAS, N-SBAS and
    MInTS algorithms. The toolbox also includes support for using PyAPS_
    to correct stratified troposphere phase components and to use GPS
    solutions if available to correct for orbital errors.
PyAPS_
    PyAPS is a python module that estimates differential phase delay maps
    due to the stratified atmosphere for correcting radar interferograms.
    It is based on Delaypackage originally written by Romain Jolivet for
    estimating phase screens due to stratified atmosphere using ECMWF's
    ERA Interim reanalysis.

    PyAPS includes support for ERA Interim, NARR and MERRA weather models.
    PyAPS uses the humidity, pressure and temperature information from
    meteorological models to estimate the dry and wet components of the
    atmospheric delay.
Varres_
    Varres is a variable resolution interferogram sampler that implements a
    curvature-based quadtree like resampler for reducing unwrapped
    interferometric phase to a smaller subset of observations.
    Using the reduced set of observations which represent the non-redundant
    observations in an unwrapped interferogram in modelling significantly
    decreases computation cost.
    Moroever, it can reduce bias due to uneven distribution of coherent
    samples in the unwrapped interferogram.

    The original matlab package has been extended to include support for
    using a predefined map for resampling and estimation of an approximate
    covariance matrix for the samples.
ROI_PAC_
    Repeat Orbit Interferometry PACkage by Caltech/Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
    mainly for interferometric SAR processing.
IDIOT_
    InSAR Deformation Inspection and Observation Tool (I.D.I.O.T.) is a software
    package for fully automatic generation of differential SAR interferograms
    from ENVISAT single look complex SAR data.

    Its main purpose is to simplify as much as possible the generation of
    differential SAR interferograms, even for complete novices in SAR
    interferometry.

    I.D.I.O.T. uses the freely available DEM of the SRTM mission to compensate
    for topography and can work with both the coarse header orbits or precise
    orbit information. All interferometric processing steps are implemented
    having maximum interferogram quality and precision in mind.
